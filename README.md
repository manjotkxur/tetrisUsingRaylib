# C++ Tetris Game using raylib

🕹️🎮💻🎨🎧  This GitHub repository is home to the full source code for a Tetris game built with the C++ programming language and the raylib library. The game uses various raylib functions for graphics, input handling, and audio and can be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. 🔍📖 The code is well-structured and easy to read, making it a valuable resource for aspiring game developers looking to learn about raylib game programming.

Things to pay ATTENTION:
  1.) uses Raylib (prerequisite)
  2.) uses Msys2 for RayLib support
  3.) uses MinGW64 for GIT Bash support
  4.) Msys2 & MinGW64 to be used together
  5.) access MinGW64 from Msys2 using "C:/msys64/mingw64.exe"
  6.) List of commands:
          a.) CLONE: git clone <repository-url>
          b.) NAVIGATE: cd <project-directory>
          c.) INSTALL DEPENDENCIES package-manager install game-library
          d.) RUN BUILD: g++ main.cpp block.cpp blocks.cpp colors.cpp game.cpp grid.cpp position.cpp -o tetris -lgame-library -lgraphics
          6.) RUN: ./tetris

Thanks! Happy coding :)
